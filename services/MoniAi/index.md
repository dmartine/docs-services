# Getting started with Moni.ai
{: #gettingstarted}

Moni.ai allows you to define new ways to interact with your business by defining Voice Channels. A Voice Channel starts with a trigger pattern that Moni listens to. After a user said that trigger pattern you define what happens visually using Node-Red. Doing that you have full control over the process and you can query databases, retrieve relevant information or call APIs and perform tasks.
After defining a Voice Channel you can talk to Moni using the iOS or Android app or using the Moni.ai website.

To design a Voice Channel, complete these steps: 

1. Deploy the Moni.ai Voice Channel designer to Bluemix.

  The Voice Channel designer is based on Node-Red having three Moni.ai nodes preinstalled. You can deploy the environment easily following the "[Moni.ai Voice Channel designer](https://hub.jazz.net/deploy/index.html?repository=https://hub.jazz.net/git/moniai/voice-channel-design){:new_window}" link.

2. Create your Voice Channel using the red Moni.ai nodes.

  For information and examples on how to create your first Voice Channel read the [Build "Voice Channels" with Moni.ai, your virtual assistant](https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/2016/02/10/voice-channels-with-moni-ai-virtual-assistant/){:new_window} tutorial.

3. Publish your Voice Channel on the Moni.ai developers page.

  After you designed your Voice Channel on Node-Red the trigger pattern will appear on the [Moni.ai developers page](https://moni.ai/developers). You are then able to publish your Voice Channel pressing the "publish" button. Your Voice Channel will then be availble to all users on Moni.ai.
