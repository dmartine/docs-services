# Getting started with Namara.io
{: #gettingstarted}

The [Namara.io](https://namara.io){:new_window} platform aggregates available open data released by all levels of government and presents it to users in a single portal. It organizes and catalogues this public data, providing users with API access to high value information.

## Instructions

By clicking 'OPEN NAMARA.IO CATALOG DASHBOARD', Bluemix will generate an account for you on [Namara.io](https://namara.io){:new_window}.

Once you are on Namara.io and logged in, hover over the user icon in the top right corner of the page and click 'Collections'. This will take you to the collections page where you can build collections and access your relevant API key.

Create a collection by clicking on the 'Create Collection' button at the bottom of the collections page. Enter a name for your collection, and click 'Create Collection'. Descriptions are optional.

Private collections will not be visible to other users, but will remain accessible via API.

Once you have created a collection, your unique API key will be visible under the title of each collection. Start adding data sets to your collections to access them via API. All API access must be associated with a collection API key.

For further information, please read the API docs.
