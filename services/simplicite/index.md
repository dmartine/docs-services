# Getting started with Simplicit&eacute;
{: #gettingstarted}

**Simplicit&eacute;** is a versatile backend enterprise application platform designed to satisfy
your custom business requirements using web-based business model configuration.

{:shortdesc}

![Screenshot](screenshot.jpg)

It brings:

* A comprehensive business engine that dynamically processes your business models (objects, workflows, rules, rights, reporting, ...).
* A full-featured generic web user interface (and its simplified mobile variant).
* Various generic APIs and integration facilities (JSON/REST and XML/SOAP webservices and their wrapper libs, I/O interface, ...).

A Simplicit&eacute; instance can be deployed:

* As a Bluemix service (this is the most straight forward approach, see below)
* As a Bluemix application or as a Docker container running on Bluemix (this is for advanced needs)

When deployed as a Bluemix service it can be bound to any Bluemix application.

The typical usage is when you want to develop a custom frontend application (using Java, PHP, Node.js, ...) that exposes
your business implemented on a Simplicit&eacute; instance using its APIs.

## Deploy a Simplicit&eacute; instance as a Bluemix service

To deploy a service you can use the Bluemix console: go to the service catalog &gt; _Web and applications_ section
and click on the Simplicit&eacute; service and follow the instructions.

You can also use the `cf` CLI:

```
cf create-service simplicite free <service instance name>
```
{: pre}

Then you can bind the service to a existing Bluemix application
(and restage the application so as the binding is actually taken into account):

```
cf bind-service <application name> <service instance name>
cf restage <application name>
```
{: pre}

Once the service is bound to the application, the connection details will be available in the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable:

```json
{
  "simplicite": [
    {
      "name": "<service instance name>",
      "label": "<service instance name>",
      "plan": "free",
      "credentials": {
        "baseURL": "<service instance base URL>",
        "scheme": "http",
        "port": "80",
        "host": "<service instance host name>"
        "restEndointURL": "<service instance base URL>/api/rest",
        "soapEndpointURL": "<service instance base URL>/api/soap",
        "rawEndpointURL": "<service instance base URL>/api/raw",
        "ioEndpointURL": "<service instance base URL>/io",
        "ioUsername": "<I/O interface username>",
        "ioPassword": "<I/O interface password>"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
{: codeblock}

Note that the only provided username/password is the **I/O services interface's username/password** which is only dedicated to technical bulk
configuration and data imports/exports using the I/O endpoint. Please refer to the API Reference related links for details on the I/O services.

The other webservices API enpoints (REST/SOAP/RAW) do not use this I/O credentials but actual business user's credentials. Defining business
user profiles and corresponding business users is part of your business configuration (and thus can't be provided in the
VCAP_SERVICES`environment variable).

Once you have configured your business users, you can start calling the webservices API (REST/SOAP/RAW) from your frontend applications that have
been bound to the Simplicit&eacute; service. Please refer to the API Reference related links for details on the webservices API.

Example:

This example is taken from a simple Node.js application that uses the demo business case:

```javascript
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

(...)

var services = JSON.parse(process.env.VCAP_SERVICES || "{}");
var simpliciteService = services.simplicite && services.simplicite.length > 0 ? services.simplicite[0].credentials : null;

if (simpliciteService) {
	var simpliciteApp = require("simplicite").session( {
		host: simpliciteService.host,
		port: simpliciteService.port,
		scheme: simpliciteService.scheme,
		user: "admin",
		password: "<admin user's password>",
		debug: false
	};);

	var productBusinessObject = simpliciteApp.getBusinessObject("DemoProduct");
	app.get("/products", function(req, res) {
		productBusinessObject.search(undefined, { inlineDocs: true }).then(function(list) {
			res.render("products", { products: JSON.stringify(list), });
		});
	});
}

(...)

app.listen(process.env.VCAP_APP_PORT || 3000, process.env.VCAP_APP_HOST || "localhost");
```
