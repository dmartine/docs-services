# Getting started with Vantrix Transcoder for Bluemix
{: #gettingstarted}

Vantrix Transcoder for Bluemix is a flexible and powerful transcoding service that you can use to adapt your single-rate VODs to multiple adaptive bitrate (ABR) outputs. It provides a complete transcoding workflow with support for various input/output formats (see [About](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/docs-services/blob/master/services/vantrix/index.md#about-supported-formats-and-codecs)) as well as closed captioning. Vantrix Transcoder includes both an intuitive UI and a REST-based HTTP API.

## Setting up Vantrix Transcoder
To add the Vantrix Transcoder service using the command line, you need the Cloud Foundry CLI installed on your computer. Get it from [https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads). Once it’s installed, you'll be able to use the `cf` command from your command line interface.

To add Vantrix Transcoder service to your Bluemix application, follow these steps:
1. Set up the Bluemix API endpoint:
  ```
  cf api https://api.ng.bluemix.net
  ```
  {: pre}
		
2. Then log in to Bluemix with your Bluemix credentials:

  ```
  cf login
  ```
  {: pre}
		
3. Choose your organization and space, and you are ready to add the Vantrix Transcoder service. 
4. Now create a service instance in your selected space, for example:

  ```
  cf create-service vantrix-transcoder free mytranscoder01
  ```
 {: pre}
	
  where ‘vantrix-transcoder free’ is the service and 'mytranscoder01' is the service instance name. 

5. Bind your Vantrix Transcoder service instance to your application, for example:

  ```
  cf bind-service MyApp mytranscoder01
  ```
  {: pre}

  where 'MyApp' is your application and ‘mytranscoder01’ is your service instance.

6. Optionally, to show the service is bound to your application, use the `cf services` command.		
7. After Vantrix Transcoder service is bound to your application, the specific configuration of your Vantrix Transcoder service will appear in your VCAP_SERVICES environment variable. To list the details, use the `cf env` command followed by your application name, for example:

```
cf env MyApp
```
{: pre}
		
where 'MyApp' is your application.
		
The output will include something like this:
		
```

	"vantrix-transcoder": [
